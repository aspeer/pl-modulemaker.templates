INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The latest version of this software is always available from Github

    git clone [% WEBSITE %]/[% repo_name %].git
    cd [% repo_name %]

If on a modern system:

cpan .

Or (faster, if available):

cpanm .

Failing that manual install:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If installing manually dependecies will have to be installed individually.
