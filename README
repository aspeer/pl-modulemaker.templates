If this is still here it means the programmer was too lazy to create the readme file.

You can create it now by using the command shown below from this directory:

pod2text [%  NAME %] > README

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module...

[%- IF BUILD_SYSTEM == 'ExtUtils::MakeMaker' -%]
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
[%- ELSE -%]
perl Build.PL
perl Build
perl Build test
perl Build install
[%- END -%]

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
